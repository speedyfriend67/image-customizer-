# Image Format Converter

This JavaScript code allows users to convert image formats easily using a web interface. Users can upload an image, choose the desired output format, and convert the image accordingly.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-format-converter.git
   cd image-format-converter
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser or host it on a web server.

3. Use the file input to select an image file.

4. Choose the desired output format from the dropdown menu.

5. Click the "Convert" button to see the converted image.

## How It Works

The JavaScript code uses the FileReader API to read the selected image file. It then creates a canvas element to draw the image and convert it to the specified format using the `toDataURL` method.

```javascript

```

## Supported Formats

The converter currently supports the following output formats:

- PNG
- JPEG

Feel free to extend the code to support additional formats as needed.
